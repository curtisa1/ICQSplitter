Running 'python ICQSplitter.py --heliocentric --phase --plot' in your terminal
in a directory with the file 'input_data.txt' will produce the files 'keepers.csv' and 'removed.csv'
Remember to make sure that the file 'Schleicher_Composite_Phase_Function.txt' is in your working directory.
You will get the following output:

> initial number of points  53
> number deleted for no magnitudereported 5
> number deleted for using reverse binocular method 0
> number deleted for poor weather conditions 0
> number deleted for a poor extinction correction 0
> number deleted for using a telescope under m = 5.4 0
> number deleted for using a binocular under m = 1.4 0
> number deleted for using a method not specified by green (i.e. column 27 not being S, B, M, I, or E), prioritizing S then M 0
> number deleted for SC catalog being used on object dimmer than 8.1  0
> number deleted for duplicated observation dates by same person 6
> final remaining points 42

And the files 'keepers.csv', 'removed.csv', 'graph_0.png', 'graph_1.png', and 'graph_2.png' should be created (as seen in the /example_data/ repository.
